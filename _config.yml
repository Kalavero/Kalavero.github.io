bio: "I am a Brazilian developer and I am very enthusiastic about technology.
      As a backend developer I have tried many languages and frameworks since I
      first started programming in 2010. Lately I've been mostly working with Ruby on Rails,
      but I have also done some things with Elixir at my current job.
      I am a self learner and enjoy learning any skill I can,
      most recently I'm learning angular and android to help my team deliver solutions faster."
